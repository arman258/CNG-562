        "Forecasting is an important statistical task in different fields of business, where it aids informing decisions about the managing the production, transportation and personnel. Forecasting provides a guidance to have long-term planning. In this project we are aiming to forecast the future price of Bitcoins and New York stock exchange. Time series forecasting is an essential part of machine learning. The importance is due to existence of many prediction problems that include a time feature. However, as the time feature provides additional information, it also makes time series problems more complex to deal, comparing with other prediction tasks.\n",
        "Forecasting how the stock market will behave is one of the most complex task to do. Many factors such as physical vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior make stock/bitcoin prices sensitive and very challenging to obtain high degree prediction accuracy. Machine learning methods have the capacity to unveil patterns and insights we didnâ€™t see before, and these can be used to make accurate predictions.\n",
        "We aim to use LSTM, and RNN to do time series forecasting of the aforementioned datasets."

We also confirmed our results with other methods such as Moving Average and Exponential Moving Average. LSTM managed to outperform these two methods proving its benefits in predicting information for time series forcasting."
